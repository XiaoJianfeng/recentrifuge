**Robust comparative analysis and contamination removal for metagenomic data**
____
## Abstract

Metagenomics sequencing is becoming more and more widespread in biomedical and biological research, and the pace is increasing thanks to nanopore sequencing. With a rising number of samples and data per sample, the challenge of efficiently comparing results within a sample and between samples arises. Such analysis is complicated by laboratory and host contaminants which demands a reliable method for the removal of negative control samples from the set of samples. This is critical in samples with low microbial biomass, where contamination can comprise most of a sample if not all. With Recentrifuge, researchers can analyze results from the Centrifuge classifier using interactive hierarchical pie charts with special emphasis on the score level of the classifications. In addition to control-substracted samples, shared taxa and exclusive taxa per sample are also provided with scores for each taxonomic level of interest, thus enabling robust comparative analysis of multiple samples in low biomass metagenomics studies.
