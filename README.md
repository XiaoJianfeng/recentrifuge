# Recentrifuge
**Robust comparative analysis and contamination removal for metagenomic data**
____

Recentrifuge enables researchers to analyze results from the Centrifuge classifier using interactive charts, but placing emphasis on the score level of the classifications by the use of a scaled color-map. 

In addition to the scored plots for the raw samples, four different sets of scored plots are generated for each taxonomic level of interest: control-subtracted samples, shared taxa (with and without subtracting the control) and exclusive taxa per sample. 

This battery of analysis and plots permits robust comparative analysis of multiple samples, specially in the case of low biomass metagenomics studies.
